## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd personalized-course-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Example `requirements.txt`:**

```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
transformers
```

### 3. Prepare Data Files

Place the following files in the project root:

- `Online_Courses.csv`
- `udemy_courses.csv`
- `Metadata.xlsx`
- (Optional) `users.xlsx`, `feedback.txt` (legacy)

### 4. Set Up Gemini API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Gemini API key:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the App

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Notes

- The app uses in-memory session state for feedback in deployment/demo mode. For persistent storage, connect to a database.
- Gemini API usage may be subject to quota limits. See [Gemini API Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits).
- For best results, use Python 3.9 or newer.
